To Whomever this may concern:
This Infanos project is something I have been working on independantly from my schoolwork since roughly
the beginning of 2014. I have loved keeping up with gaming and gaming technology and wanted to create
my very own application that does a variety of things. I wanted to create  a storefront (more so just
to gain experience in doing so), use database access for various items, have an administrator backend,
have users be able to submit reviews, and eventually have a forum with which users could post various
things. My goal was to gain more experience with ASP.NET Webforms along with creating something
within a realm that I enjoy.
